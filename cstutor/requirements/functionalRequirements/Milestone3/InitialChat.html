        <p>
			Users will be able to open the chat box by clicking on the "Chat" button in the lower right hand side of the screen. When users open the chat box, they will see something
			roughly identical to the picture in 2.6.1
			<br/><br/>
			Users will be able to come and go as they please. They will automatically be logged into and placed inside a default channel (room) of their choice.
        </p>

        <p>
			The chat and who's online will be separate buttons, but for the purpose of this document, I showed them both open together. The box on the left will be the main chat program.
			The top box is a console that will display all of the messages that are being submitted by the users.
			<br/><br/>
			The bottom half of that box is the text space where you can type your message. When the "enter" button is pressed, all of the text currently inside the text box will be
			displayed in the console for people to view. A time stamp and your username will be displayed as auxiliary information for the rest of the users.
			<br/><br/>
			The display on the right is where the current users accessing the tool will be displayed. Instructors will be highlighted in green. 
        </p>

		<h3 style = "text-align:center">2.6.1.2 Private Messaging Users</h3>
		<p>
			Clicking on the little triangles next to the user will bring up a drop down menu with the options "Private Message" and "View Session". This is illustrated in Figure 2.6.2.
		</p>

		</figure>		
		<p>
			When the user clicks on "Private Message" button, a separate window will appear that will allow the user to chat in the exact same capacity and function as the regular chat.
			An example of this can be seen in Figure 2.6.3
		</p>

		<h3 style = "text-align:center">2.6.1.3 Remote Viewing</h3>
		<p>
			Users can initiate remote viewing in very much the same way as a private message. By clicking on "View Session" from the drop down menu next to the student's name,
			a separate window will appear that will display what the user is seeing and doing. An example of this is shown in figure 2.6.4.
		</p>

		</figure>
		<p>
			The user can interact with everything in the window like they normally would with a regular tutorial page.

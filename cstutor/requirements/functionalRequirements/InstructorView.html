            The instructor user is designed to have a few more privileges then the standard user. In addition to sharing their screen and requesting private chat, instructors may also request to view the sessions of the students.

        <h3 style = "text-align:center">2.6.2.1 Drop Down Menu</h3>
        <p>
            Clicking on the little triangles next to the user brings up a drop down menu with the options "Private Message", "View Session" and "Share Session". This is illustrated in Figure 2.6.2.1
        </p>

        </figure>       
        <p>
            When the user clicks on "Private Message" button, a separate window appears, waiting for acceptance from the Student that the Instructor requested a chat with. This is shown in figure 2.6.2.2 Chat is not limited between Instructors and Students. Any user may request a chat with any other user. Simultaniously, the user that's getting the request recieves a window as shown in figure 2.6.2.3
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class = imageAlignment src = "chatImages/Instructor2.jpg" width = "35%" style="border:2px solid black">
            <figcaption style = "text-align:center"> Fig 2.6.2.2 </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the above figure 2.6.2.2, the user is prompted with a message that informs the instructor that the chat is still waiting on approval from the student. 
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Mean while, the student that's being queried is be prompted with a screan like the above. If he selects "Accept", a window apears that's identical to figure 2.6.2.2 for the student, and the Instructor and the Student comunicate. If he declines, the Instructor is informed. 
        </p>

        <h3 style = "text-align:center"> 2.6.3 Remote Viewing </h3>
        <p>
            Instructors has the ability to both request for a student to share their screen, or invite other to view his own. An instructor may invite multiple people to view his screen, in case he'd like to show multiple students at a time. However, he may only requestion to view one student's screen at a time. Using the same drop down menu from Figure 5.6.2.1, the Instructor requests a to view a student screen. A window like Figure 2.6.2.6 appears. 
        </p>
        
        <figure>
            <img class = imageAlignment src = "chatImages/Instructor5.jpg" width = "50%" >
            <figcaption style = "text-align:center"> Fig 2.6.2.5 </figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p> 
            Mean while the student recieves a window like that's nearly identical to Figure 2.6.2.3 Except they're prompted with text that says "Instructor would like to view your screen". Once the student Accepts, the window populates with what the student is currently working on. 
        </p>
        
        
        <figure>
            <img class = imageAlignment src = "chatImages/Instructor6.jpg" width = "50%" >
            <figcaption style = "text-align:center"> Fig 2.6.2.6 </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The user interacts with everything in the window like they normally do with a regular tutorial page. Notice how this user seems to be having some trouble with while loops.
			The instructor is able to make all the necessary changes, perhaps while talking with the student in a separate chat window about why he's making the changes. 
        </p>
